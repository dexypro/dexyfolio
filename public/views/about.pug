                    | Hi, my name is Dejan. I am a 32-year-old 
                    strong  Junior Full-Stack Developer
                    | . Both as a developer and in my everyday life, I strive for   
                    strong efficiency
                    | . I have serious 
                    strong passion 
                    | for UI effects, animations and creating intuitive and 
                    strong dynamic 
                    | user experiences. 
                    | Further improving my knowledge in this field and adapting to new technologies 
                    | never overwhelms me, yet presents an inexhaustible source of enjoyment.

                    | I’ve always been a tech enthusiast, and since I got my first Pentium III 
                    | at the age of 12 in early 
                    strong 2003
                    | , I've been curious about anything related to computers. 
                    | My journey as a programmer began somewhere in 
                    strong 2010 
                    | when I became a developer on a World of Warcraft private server. 
                    | My duties included improving game scripts and controlling the database. 
                    | This enabled me to get a fairly solid understanding of 
                    strong C++  
                    | and 
                    strong SQL

                p(class='header body gap about-three')
                    | In time the WoW community moved on and I started looking for another 
                    | platform on which I could express my creative ideas. 
                    | I dabbled in several programming languages like 
                    strong Python 
                    | and  
                    strong Lua 
                    | for some time but eventually got around to learning  
                    strong Javascript 
                    | and the whole palette of front-end technologies.

                p(class='header body gap about-four')
                    | Other than web development, I’m also passionate about  
                    strong C#  
                    | and game development in the 
                    strong Unity Engine 
                    | .
                    | When I'm not coding, drawing vectors or pushing pixels, 
                    | you'll find me playing guitar and singing or competitively 
                    | playing online video games.
